## cloud.gov common Concourse pipeline tasks

This repo contains the source for some common concourse-ci.org pipeline tasks.

To include in your pipeline, define a resource named `pipeline-tasks`:
```yaml
resources:

...

- name: pipeline-tasks
  type: git
  source:
    uri: ((pipeline-tasks-git-url))
    branch: ((pipeline-tasks-git-branch))
```

Add `pipeline-tasks-git-url` and `pipeline-tasks-git-branch` to your `credentials.yml`:

```yaml
---
pipeline-tasks-git-url: https://github.com/18F/cg-pipeline-tasks.git
pipeline-tasks-git-branch: master
```
